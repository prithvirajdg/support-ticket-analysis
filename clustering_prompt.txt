Below are problem statements extracted from Porter user reviews.
Each line is: row_id | summarised_problem | fidelity | journey | stage | mechanism | team | impact

Group them into atomic clusters where each cluster represents exactly one
specific underlying problem — same mechanism, same failure mode.

---

WHAT BELONGS IN THE SAME CLUSTER

Two problems belong in the same cluster only when ALL of these are true:
- Same journey, same stage, same mechanism, and same team
- Two problems with the same mechanism but different failure modes are
  different clusters — "waiting time compensation not triggered" and
  "waiting time compensation incorrectly applied" share a mechanism but
  need different fixes
- Same failure mode, OR both are outcome descriptions of the same mechanism
  with no identifiable failure mode
- Same fidelity — never merge pain_and_touchpoint with pain_only, and never
  merge feature_request with either

---

WHAT MUST NEVER BE MERGED

- Different journeys or teams → always separate clusters, no exceptions
- Different failure modes on the same touchpoint → always separate clusters.
  "Compensation not triggered" and "compensation incorrectly applied" both
  involve waiting time compensation but need different fixes — they are
  different clusters
- Different fidelity values → always separate clusters
- Shared vocabulary alone is not enough to merge. "Payment not received by
  partner" and "fare not collected from customer at drop" both contain
  "payment" but describe different mechanisms owned by different teams
- Surface similarity is not enough. "Orders decreasing" and "timer delay
  preventing order acceptance" are both about order volume but are different
  problems with different owners
- Geographic variation is not a split signal — the same problem in Bangalore
  and Mumbai is one cluster
- Vehicle type may be a split signal — "for 2-wheelers" vs "for trucks" may
  involve different policies; split if the mechanism or rule differs

---

SELF-CHECK BEFORE FINALISING

For each cluster ask: would the exact same engineering or policy fix resolve
every problem in it? If any problem would need a different fix, split.

CLUSTER NAMING

Format: [mechanism] [failure mode verb or outcome verb] [condition if defining]

Rules:
- Start with the mechanism, not the user — "waiting time compensation not
  triggered" not "partner not receiving compensation"
- Use lowercase
- Must contain a verb — noun phrases are invalid cluster names
- Include the condition only when it defines the cluster ("at pickup" vs
  "at drop" may be different failure paths; include it)
- Strip conditions that are incidental detail (city names, specific amounts)
- Under 12 words

Good examples:
- waiting time compensation not triggered at pickup
- document verification stalled after submission
- account suspended without prior warning
- fare on app not matching amount collected at drop
- support not processing refund after dispute raised

Bad examples (and why):
- "compensation issue" — no verb, no mechanism
- "onboarding problem" — journey name, not mechanism
- "Partner account issue" — starts with user, no verb
- "payment discrepancy" — no mechanism, no verb
- "support not helping" — no specific failure named

Output a CSV table with three columns, including a header row:
row_id,cluster_id,cluster_name

PROBLEMS:
1 | waiting time compensation not triggered after threshold exceeded at pickup | pain_and_touchpoint | Order Execution | coordinate loading | waiting time compensation | LFC | financial_loss
2 | account suspended without prior warning or investigation | pain_and_touchpoint | Account & Compliance | suspension | account suspension | LFC | blocked
